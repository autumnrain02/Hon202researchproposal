        <div><p>Human trafficking survivors' perspective of effective preventative measures differs. According to Bending Towards Justice: Perceptions of Justice Among Human Trafficking Survivors, “domestic sex trafficking survivors did not believe incarceration could work to prevent further trafficking, whereas labor trafficking survivors often did not desire incarceration for reasons related to their recovery processes.” This is important because survivors' distinct experiences reflect how the criminal justice system treats both them and the traffickers and how effective preventative measures are.</br>
          
                            </br>Additionally, the study states, “survivors of sex and labor trafficking distinguished between their definitions of “justice” for themselves and “justice” for their traffickers. They expressed nuanced views on the latter, often wanting to see traffickers prevented from inflicting harm again but expressing doubts that the criminal justice system could accomplish this.</br>
                            
                            </br>Although a small number of survivors wished to see their traffickers incarcerated, most expressed uncertainty that prison would truly “work” to repair the harms caused or prevent further trafficking. The most salient theme across interviews was that survivors defined “justice” as preventing traffickers from inflicting harm again, with the two most common suggestions being educational awareness and visa restrictions for traffickers” (Hussemann et al., 2018). This information here is even more important because it explains why they believe that prosecution may not reduce trafficking. Because of that, they believe they are not achieving their version of what justice means, preventing the trafficker from inflicting harm on others.</br>
