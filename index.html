        <div><p> Worldwide, 24.9 million people are trafficked into forced labor, 4.8 million involving sexual exploitation. The trafficking industry is considered the world’s second-largest criminal industry, where sexual exploitation generates 99 billion dollars. The average annual profit generated by each sexually exploited individual is 100,000 dollars (human rights first, 2017). In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the growing industry of sexual exploitation.</br>
          
                            </br>How do we combat this criminal industry? Many propose that this is achievable by enacting legislation that formulates preventative measures. The preventative measures must be proven effective in reducing trafficking cases through a comprehensive analysis and understanding of what resources survivors need and what measures reduce their exploitation.</br>
                            
                            </br>My research proposal examines the different theorized legislation that individuals believe will lead to the reduction of sex trafficking. By analyzing the legality of prostitution in other countries, I can determine which legislation is more effective in reducing human trafficking and helping survivors. This research is particularly important to me because I want to advocate and work first-hand with human trafficking survivors. I also want to become a criminal prosecutor for human trafficking and child exploitation cases in the future. To be capable of this, I must have comprehensive knowledge of the best preventative methods. Having knowledge of previous literature on this and formulating an analysis will be vital to my future career choices and in providing help to human trafficking survivors.</br>
